<p>
Sustainable Development Goal 7 focuses on ensuring that everyone has access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy. 
Energy powers almost every part of modern life—transportation, communication, hospitals, schools, and even the device you're using right now. 
However, billions of people still lack access to clean cooking fuels or reliable electricity.
</p>

<p>
The world heavily depends on fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. These sources release greenhouse gases that warm the planet and 
cause long-term environmental damage. SDG 7 pushes the world to shift toward renewable alternatives such as solar, wind, hydropower, and 
geothermal energy. These technologies not only reduce pollution but also provide safer, healthier, and more stable energy options for all.

<p>
Achieving SDG 7 is critical for global development. Clean energy improves education (students can study at night), boosts healthcare 
(refrigeration for medicines), increases economic opportunities (more jobs in green energy), and reduces environmental harm.  
This website explores what SDG 7 is, why it matters, and how we can help create a cleaner energy future.

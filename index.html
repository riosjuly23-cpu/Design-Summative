    <p>
        SDG 7 is more than just a sustainability goal—it is a global promise.  
        Today, energy powers every aspect of life: learning, industry, transportation, healthcare, communication, and social development.  
        Without clean, reliable, and affordable energy, communities cannot grow or thrive.
    </p>

    <p>
        Around the world, billions rely on fossil fuels, causing pollution, climate change, and health problems.  
        SDG 7 works toward transforming our energy systems into something renewable, efficient, and accessible for ALL people—regardless of income, location, or resources.

    <h2>Why Clean Energy Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Clean energy helps reduce greenhouse gases, decreases dependency on harmful fuels, and leads to healthier, safer communities.  
        It also creates jobs, supports innovation, and drives economic stability.  
        Every step toward renewable energy is a step toward a cleaner future.
    </p>

    <p>
        By advocating for SDG 7, we promote fairness, development, scientific innovation, and environmental protection.  
        Affordable energy allows children to study, hospitals to operate, and communities to grow sustainably.

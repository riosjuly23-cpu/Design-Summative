  <h2>Welcome to My SDG 7 Website</h2>
  <p>
    This website is part of my school project based on SDG 7, which stands for 
    “Affordable and Clean Energy.” I created this website to raise awareness
    about why clean energy is important and how it affects our world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Energy is something we use every single day—charging phones, switching on 
    lights, running fans, using computers, and even cooking food. But many 
    people around the world do not have access to safe and reliable energy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout this website, I explain what clean energy is, why it matters,
    and how even schools and students like us can help. I used simple HTML and
    CSS to design my pages because I'm still learning website coding.
  </p>

<h1>Solutions to Achieve SDG 7</h1>

<p>
Reaching SDG 7 will require global cooperation, innovation, and strong political leadership. The transition to clean energy is already 
happening, but it must accelerate quickly. Several solutions can help countries reduce emissions, expand energy access, and build a more 
sustainable future.
</p>

<h2>1. Expanding Renewable Energy</h2>
<p>
Solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal energy are becoming cheaper and more efficient. Governments and private companies should invest 
in building renewable infrastructure, especially in rural or underdeveloped regions that lack access to reliable electricity. Renewable 
energy can power homes, hospitals, schools, and farms without damaging the environment.

<h2>2. Improving Energy Efficiency</h2>
<p>
Sometimes, the best way to save energy is simply to use it more wisely. Energy-efficient appliances, LED lighting, electric vehicles, and 
green buildings reduce energy waste dramatically. When millions of people adopt efficient technologies, global energy consumption drops 
significantly.
</p>

<h2>3. Investing in Clean Cooking Technologies</h2>
<p>
Nearly 2.4 billion people still cook using wood, charcoal, or animal waste. This causes indoor air pollution and major health risks. 
Introducing clean stoves, biogas systems, or electric induction cookers can improve health outcomes and reduce deforestation.
</p>

<h2>4. Education and Awareness</h2>
<p>
Schools and communities must be educated about sustainable energy use. Students can learn how renewable energy works, how to reduce 
consumption, and why climate change matters. Awareness leads to responsible choices, which builds a more sustainable society.

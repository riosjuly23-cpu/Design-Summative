  <h2>Types of Clean Energy</h2>

  <h3>1. Solar Energy</h3>
  <p>
    Solar energy is one of the most popular clean energy sources. Solar panels 
    convert sunlight into electricity. Many homes and schools around the world 
    use solar panels because they are environmentally friendly and reduce 
    electricity bills.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Wind Energy</h3>
  <p>
    Wind turbines use the power of moving air to produce electricity. Wind farms 
    can generate large amounts of renewable energy without causing pollution.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Hydropower</h3>
  <p>
    Hydropower uses the movement of water to create energy. Large dams generate 
    electricity for entire cities. It is reliable and renewable.

  <h2>What Schools Can Do</h2>
  <p>
    Schools can take small but effective steps to save energy. One simple method 
    is switching off lights and fans when not needed. Replacing old bulbs with 
    LED lights also saves energy and money.
  </p>

  <p>
    Schools can also start eco clubs, conduct clean energy workshops, or even 
    install small solar panels to power parts of the building. These actions help 
    students learn about sustainability and make a real difference.

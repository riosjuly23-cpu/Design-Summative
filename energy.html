<h1>Why Clean Energy Matters</h1>

<p>
Energy is the backbone of global progress. Every country depends on it for transportation, communication systems, healthcare, manufacturing, 
and even food production. When energy is unreliable or too expensive, people struggle to access basic services, which widens the global 
inequality gap. SDG 7 aims to close this gap by ensuring that everyone—regardless of their country or economic status—has access to clean 
and affordable energy.

<p>
The use of fossil fuels has powered industries for years, but it comes with major consequences. Burning coal and oil releases tons of carbon 
dioxide and pollutants into the atmosphere, leading to air pollution, global warming, and severe health problems. Many developing nations rely 
heavily on these fuels because they are cheap, but they pay the price with poor air quality and illness.

<p>
Clean energy technologies offer a better path. Solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric dams produce electricity without polluting the 
environment. They also reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports, making countries more energy secure. Switching to clean energy can create 
millions of new jobs, particularly for young engineers, technicians, and sustainability professionals.
</p>

<p>
In short, clean energy is not just a scientific or environmental topic—it is a human rights issue. Access to clean energy can drastically 
improve living conditions and protect the planet for future generations.

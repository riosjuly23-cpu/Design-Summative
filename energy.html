  <h2>Energy Problems</h2>
  <p>
    Many people around the world still do not have access to electricity. Without electricity,
    students cannot study at night, hospitals cannot run equipment, and families cannot keep food safe.
  </p>

  <h2>Global Impact</h2>
  <p>
    Using fossil fuels like coal and oil causes pollution and climate change.
    Clean energy can reduce these problems and protect the environment.

  <h2>The Global Energy Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Today, over 600 million people around the world still do not have access 
    to electricity. This means millions of families live without basic lighting, 
    safe cooking methods, or the ability to charge a phone or run a fan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lack of energy affects education too. Students cannot study at night, 
    teachers cannot use digital tools, and schools struggle to run science labs 
    or computers. Energy is directly linked to learning and opportunities.
  </p>

  <h2>Energy and Climate Change</h2>
  <p>
    Most of the electricity in the world still comes from fossil fuels like 
    coal, oil, and gas. When these fuels are burned, they release carbon dioxide 
    and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This leads to global warming 
    and climate change.
  </p>

  <p>
    Climate change causes rising temperatures, stronger storms, melting ice caps,
    droughts, and flooding. All of these things affect ecosystems, wildlife,
    and human life. Clean energy is one of the biggest solutions to slow down
    climate change.
  </p>

  <h2>Why SDG 7 Exists</h2>
  <p>
    SDG 7 was created so that by 2030, the entire world can have access to clean,
    reliable, and affordable energy. This goal encourages countries to shift to
    renewable resources like sunlight, wind, and water.

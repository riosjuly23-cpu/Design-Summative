  <h2>Purpose of This Website</h2>
  <p>
    I created this website for my school SDG project. My goal was to explain 
    SDG 7 in a simple way using beginner-level coding. I researched information 
    from reliable sources like the United Nations and the International Energy 
    Agency.
  </p>

  <h2>How I Made It</h2>
  <p>
    I made this website using very basic HTML and CSS. I watched a few YouTube 
    tutorials and practiced simple tags like headings, paragraphs, lists, and 
    links. I also learned how to use GitHub Pages to host the website online.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>
    While creating this project, I learned the importance of clean energy and 
    how technology can help protect the planet. I also gained basic web 
    development skills which I hope to improve more in the future.

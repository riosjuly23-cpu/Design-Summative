    <p>
        SDG 7 is one of the 17 Global Goals set by the United Nations.  
        It focuses on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.
    </p>

    <p>
        Energy is the backbone of development: it powers schools, hospitals, transportation, and homes.  
        Without clean energy, countries face pollution, inequality, and environmental destruction.
    </p>

    <h2>The Main Targets of SDG 7</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure universal access to affordable and reliable modern energy.</li>
        <li>Increase the share of renewable energy worldwide.</li>
        <li>Improve energy efficiency globally.</li>
        <li>Promote access to clean energy research and technology.</li>
        <li>Enhance international cooperation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why SDG 7 is Urgent</h2>
    <p>
        Today, many communities still face energy poverty.  
        People cook using wood or coal, children study without lights, and hospitals rely on unstable power sources.  
        Achieving SDG 7 can transform lives on a massive scale.

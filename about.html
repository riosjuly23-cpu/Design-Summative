<p>
This website was created to support learning and awareness about Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7): Affordable and Clean Energy. 
It was designed for students, educators, and anyone interested in understanding how energy impacts our daily lives and the environment.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this project is to present clean, easy-to-read information about why energy matters, what problems the world currently faces, 
and what solutions exist to build a more sustainable future. Each page provides a different perspective—from scientific facts to practical 
actions that individuals and communities can take.
</p>

<p>
The project also demonstrates basic web design skills, including creating multi-page navigation, embedding images, structuring content, 
and presenting research in a clear digital format. It reflects an understanding of global issues and shows how technology can help spread 
awareness.
